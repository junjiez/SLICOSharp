__SLICO#: SLICO Superpixel Segmentation in C# (.NET)__

SLICOSuperpixelCSharp is a C# implementation of the SLICO superpixel segmentation algorithm by Achanta et al. (PAMI'12, vol. 34, num. 11, pp. 2274-2282)[1]. 

The C# implementation is a standalone program and can be compiled into a .Net library.
